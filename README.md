## 📝 Overview

This week we explored essential data structures in Java, learning how they help store, organize, and retrieve data effectively. We covered:

- Linked Lists (Single, Double, Circular)  
- Stacks and Queues  
- HashMaps and Hashing Functions  
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick)  
- Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary)  
- Java utilities like `StringBuilder`, `StringBuffer`, and file readers  
- Algorithm efficiency with Big-O notation and runtime analysis
